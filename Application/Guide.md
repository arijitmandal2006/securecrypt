### 🔐 SecureCrypt User Guide

Hi! Here is the encryption tool I built. It lets you password-protect any file on your computer.

#### 🚀 How to Run It

1.  Download the file
   🔽 [ SecureCrypt.exe](https://github.com/arijitmandal2006/securecrypt/blob/main/Application/SecureCrypt.exe)


2.  **Double-click** it.

3.  A black window will pop up. Don't worry, that is the application!

#### 🔒 How to Encrypt a File

1.  Type `1` and press **Enter** (Select "Encrypt").

2.  Type `2` and press **Enter** (Select "File Input").

3.  A **window will pop up**. Find the file you want to lock (like a photo, PDF, or text file) and click **Open**.

4.  The app will ask for a **Password**. Type a secret password and press **Enter**.

    -   *Note: Maybe you won't see the password while typing (for security), but it is being typed!*

5.  **Done!** A new file ending in `.enc` (e.g., `photo.png.enc`) is created in the same folder. You can now delete the original file if you want.

#### 🔓 How to Decrypt (Unlock) a File

1.  Type `2` and press **Enter** (Select "Decrypt").

2.  Type `2` and press **Enter** (Select "File Input").

3.  Select the **`.enc` file** you want to unlock.

4.  Type the **same password** you used to lock it.

5.  **Done!** Your original file will reappear (ending in `.dec`), ready to use.

#### ⚠️ Important Notes

-   **Do not lose your password!** There is no "Forgot Password" button. If you lose it, the file is gone forever.

-   **Windows Warning:** When you first run it, Windows might say *"Windows protected your PC"* because I made this myself and didn't pay Microsoft for a certificate.

    -   Just click **"More info"** → **"Run anyway"**. It is safe!
